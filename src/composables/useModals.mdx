# useModals composable - this composable is used to manage the modals state and provide the modals show/hide logic.

## Principles
- Each modal component should be built using the `BaseModal` component from the `@ui-common-library` package.
- Each Modal is responsible for detecting if it should be shown or not based on the `visibleModal` reactive value.
- `visibleModal` is a reactive value that is provided by the `useModals` composable, that way we make sure there is always only one modal visible.
- Any modal can be shown from anywhere in the app by calling the `showModal` method from the `useModals` composable and passing the modal name as a parameter.

## useModals composable interface
- `visibleModal: ref<EModal | null>(null)`: reactive value that holds the name of the currently visible modal
- `showModal: () => void`: method that is used to show a modal by passing the modal name as a parameter
- `hideModal: () => void`: method that is used to hide the currently visible modal

`EModal` enum is defined per app and contains the names of all available modals that are used in the app.

NOTE: As TypeScript is not used yet in the apps we can simulate the enum by defining a variable like below:
```
export const EModal = {
  welcome: 0,
  go_to_holofuel: 1
}
```

## Usage:
1. Build modal component

```
// eg. GoToHoloFuelModal.vue
<template>
  <BaseModal
    :is-visible="visibleModal === EModal.go_to_holofuel"
    @close="hideModal"
  >
    // Modal content
  </BaseModal>
</template>

<script setup>
...
import { useModals } from '@uicommon/composables/useModals'
import { EModal } from '@/constants/ui'
...

const { visibleModal, hideModal } = useModals()
</script>
```

2. Mount the Modal component in the app.

3. Use composable to show the modal from any component.
```
<script setup>
  ...
  import { useModals } from '@uicommon/composables/useModals'
  import { EModal } from '@/constants/ui'
  ...
  const { showModal } = useModals()
  ...
  showModal(EModal.go_to_holofuel)
  ...
</script>
```

4. Use composable to hide the modal from any component.
```
<script setup>
  ...
  import { useModals } from '@uicommon/composables/useModals'
  ...
  const { hideModal } = useModals()
  ...
  hideModal()
  ...
</script>
```
